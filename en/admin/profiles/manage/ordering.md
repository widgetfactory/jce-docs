The order of profiles is important in determing which profiles are loaded by the editor. The first profile in the **Profiles List** with the lowest Order value will be assessed first and if its restriction settings match the environment and user using the editor the profile will be loaded, otherwise the profile with the next lowest Order value will be assessed and so on.

Profiles can be ordered in 3 ways:

1. Click on the up and down arrows to move a profile up or down in the order.
