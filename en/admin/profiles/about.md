**JCE Editor Profiles** are individual instances of the editor with unique layouts and parameters.

A profile can be assigned to an **area** of Joomla! (front-end, back-end or both), a **device** (desktop, tablet, phone), Joomla! **component**, Joomla! **usertype** (author, editor, publisher etc.), **user** or any combination of these, and have its own layout (buttons) and parameters.

The Profiles list shows all existing profiles and includes a **name**, **description**, **state** and **order** for each listed profile.
