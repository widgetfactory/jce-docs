1. Select the file in the **File Browser** window of the File Manager dialog by clicking on its name.
2. The **URL**, **Text**, **Date** and **Size** fields will be filled with the relevant properties of the file. If the link is being applied to a text selection, the option of overwriting this text with the file name will be given.  
    
  If the file type is supported by the Google™ Docs Viewer - docx,xlsx,pptx,pdf,pages,ai,psd,tiff,dxf,svg,ps,ttf,xps,rar - The Google™ Docs Viewer options will be enabled.
