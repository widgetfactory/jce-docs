A **block element** is a container for text and other elements like images and tables. Block elements typically start on a new line. A paragraph is an example of a block element.

The **Format List** provides a list of block elements that can be applied to a selection. Choosing one of these will either change the selected element or wrap the selection in the chosen block element.

The list contains the block elements Paragraph, DIV, Address, Preformatted, Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, Heading 4, Heading 5, Heading 6, Code and Code Sample. This list can be edited in the [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Profiles Editor Parameters**</span>](index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=318:profiles-editor-parameters&catid=100&Itemid=93 "Editor Parameters")

### **Applying a Format**

Select the element or text. Select the format element from the Format List ![editor_format_list](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/editor_format_list.png)

### **Paragraph**

This is the most common block element and is created by pressing the enter key in the editor (SHIFT + Enter will create a linebreak instead) Used to structure text within a document. Paragraphs cannot contain other paragraphs.

### **DIV**

This is a structural block element that represents a division or section in an HTML document. Less common in article content, it is useful for grouping other block elements together as it can contain other block elements, unlike paragraphs.

### **Address**

This element is may be used by authors to supply contact information for a document or a major part of a document such as a form. This element often appears at the beginning or end of a document. Not commonly used within single articles.

### **Preformatted**

This element is used to designate text as preformatted and therefore not subject to some styling and formatting implemented by the browser. For example, preformatted text will not wrap.

### **Heading 1 to 6**

A heading element briefly describes the topic of the section it introduces. For example, each one of the sections in this article, Paragraph, DIV, Address etc. all use the Heading 3 element. A heading element usually displays as slightly larger than surrounding text.

### **Code**

Designates a fragment of computer code.

### **Code Sample**

Designates sample output from programs, scripts, etc.

### **Blockquote** ![blockquote](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/buttons/blockquote.gif)

Although not listed in the **Format List,** Blockquote is a block element and is used to designate quoted text. Blockquotes can be applied to paragraphs and text selections by clicking the **blockquote** button ![blockquote](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/buttons/blockquote.gif)

The appearance of some block elements like code, heading, preformatted and blockquote might differ on your site due to the styling applied to these elements by your site's template.
