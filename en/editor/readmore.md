The **Read More** and **Page Break** buttons perform a similar function to the ones found below the editor, but are designed to correctly handle a variety of insert positions, correctly splitting block elements where required, so that the resulting HTML is rendered without errors when the article is displayed in the front-end.

### Read More

The **Read More** button inserts a [Joomla Read More](https://docs.joomla.org/Splitting_an_Article_into_an_introduction_with_a_link_to_read_more "Actions Page Discussion View source History Splitting an Article into an introduction with a link to read more") placeholder into content, allowing the content to be displayed as Intro Text, with a link to "Read More" at the point where the placeholder was inserted.

To insert a Read More placeholder, place the cursor in the position where you want the Read More link to be displayed and click the Read More button.

Content before this will be displayed as "Introduction Text" when the article is rendered in the front-page.

To delete a Read More, click on the placeholder and press the Delete button on your keyboard.

Note:

- If the Read More is inserted at the beginning of a paragraph, it will be inserted before the paragraph.
- If the Read More is inserted at the end of a paragraph, it will be inserted after the paragraph.
- If the Read More is inserted in the middle of a paragraph, the paragraph will be split by the Read More at that point.

### Page Break

Page Break splits an article into multiple linked pages. Each page is defined by the position where each Page Break is inserted.

To insert a Page Break, click the Page Break button, and set a title for the page, and optionally an alias for the Table Of Contents listing that will be displayed created when the page is rendered in the front-end.
