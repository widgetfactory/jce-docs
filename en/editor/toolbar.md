Most of the Editor's functions are accessed from the toolbar, which contains rows of buttons and lists that execute various commands on article content, like Bold ![edit-bold](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/buttons/edit-bold.png) or Underline ![edit-underline](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/edit-underline.png) or open a dialog for actions like inserting images ![image](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/buttons/image.png) or creating tables ![table-new](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/table-new.png)

The layout of the buttons in the toolbar and which buttons are available for the user can be set in the [Features](index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=312:profiles-features&catid=100:profiles "Features") section of the [Profiles](index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=100 "Profiles") editor.

Buttons in the toolbar have 3 states - Enabled, Disabled and Active.

Most buttons are <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabled</span> by default appearing fully opaque. An enabled button can be clicked to execute its command or open the associated dialog.

A **Disabled** button will not respond if clicked and appears as a transparent version of the button. A button is disabled when the current action or cursor position is not relevant for that button, for example the Delete Table button ![editor button enabled](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/editor_button_enabled.png) will be disabled ![editor button disabled](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/editor_button_disabled.png) when no table is selected or the cursor is not within a table, and enabled when the cursor is within a table.

<span>An **Active** button indicates that the current selection in the editor content can be edited by the buttons function. For example when an existing link is selected the Link button ![editor link](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/editor_link.png) becomes active ![editor button active](https://cdn.joomlacontenteditor.net/images/docs/editor/editor_button_active.png) When the button is clicked and the Link dialog is opened, the properties of the selected link are shown in the relevant dialog fields such as URL or Title.</span>
